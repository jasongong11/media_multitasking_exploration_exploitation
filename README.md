# media_multitasking_exploration_exploitation
This is a project analyzing the relationship between media multitasking and exploration vs. exploitation.

## Data
The raw data and the processed data is contained in the data directory.

## Functions
The functions used to fit the Kalman Filter model for four armed bandit task is contained in the utils/fit_function.py
This function is a python implementation of the algorithm introduced in [Daw et al. 2006](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature04766).

## Analysis
There are a total of three steps:
Step 1: process meta data and the data from the questionaire. In this step, we build indices for media multitasking, curiosity and other demographic variables.
Step 2: behavioral analysis. In this step, we filtered out outlier behavioral participants based on a Gaussian Mixture Model. Then we fitted the Kalman Filter Mean Tracking model to estiamte individual differences of exploration tendencies. 
Step 3: Applying statistical analysis to test hypothesis.
